int main(int argc, char *argv[])

   /*
    * This sample server test program is straight forward.
    * After creating an instance of the application core
    * and passing it the configuration file, it registers
    * a class factory for handling requests with application
    * id Mip4ApplicationId. The the configuration filename is passed in as
    * an argument.
    * 
    * With the following implementation, every time the a message with
      Mip4applicationId arrives, 
       if it belongs to an existing session => the msg is passed to the session
       if its SessionId is new to the server => it will create a new session 
          obj, and the message will be passed to the session message handler.

     The HandleDisconnect method of the session object needs to deallocate 
     itself, since the openDiameter library only removes the session from its
     internal database,but it is the responsability of the application creating
     the session to deallocate it.

    * Another option to implement the server is to create the maximum number
    of sessions that this server will handle simultanously , and when a session
    terminates the session will be flaged as an unused session, which will 
    be reused when the server receives a msg related to a new session.

    This can be implemented by overwriting the "create" method in the 
    AAAServerSessionClassFactory. The create method is going to create a new 
    server session object only if there is no unused session object and 
    number of session objects did not exceed the maximum limit.

    In this case the HandleDisconnect method of the session object needs 
    flag the session object as unused, so the "create" function can make use 
    of it when needed. 
    The exit routine will need to deallocate all the session objects
    previously allocated.
    
    * On exit, the factory should be removed
    * from the application core and the application cores
    * destructor will perform internal cleanup.
    *
