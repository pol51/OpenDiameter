              clients will hint for stateful sessions. If
              set to 0 or if missing then stateless sessions.

              The value of auth-session state can actually 
              negotiated between client and server. So for 
              the server, auth-session-state is used as follows:

              1. If the request message sent by the client 
                 contains an auth-session-state, the server 
                 check's it's own configuration. If the values 
                 are equal then the server uses that value to 
                 determine statefulness. If the values are not 
                 equal and the server's configuration is set to 
                 AAA_SESSION_STATE_MAINTAINED, then the client's 
                 value determines the statefulness of the session. 
                 If the values are not equal and the server's 
                 configuration is NOT AAA_SESSION_STATE_MAINTAINED 
                 then the server's configuration determines the 
                 statefulness.
              2. If the request message sent by the client does 
                 not contain an auth-session-state, the server 
                 check's the settings of SetAuthSessionState() 
                 function. If SetAuthSessionState() returns a 
                 value, it is used to determine the statefulness 
                 of the session otherwise the configuration value 
                 is used.

              Based on the above policy, the server will return 
              an auth-session-state avp in answer message.

              For the client:

              1. The initial request sent by the client can contain 
                 an auth-session-state value as a hint to the server. 
                 This value is taken from the settings of SetAuthSessionState() 
                 function. If SetAuthSessionState() returns a value, 
                 it is used to as a hint value otherwise the configuration 
                 value is used.
              2. If the answer message sent by the server contains 
                 an auth-session-state, then that value will be used 
                 by the client. If no auth-session-state avp is sent, 
                 then the hint sent in (1) is used.
