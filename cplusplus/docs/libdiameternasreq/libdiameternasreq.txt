\section Introduction

The libdiameternasreq library provides a C++ API to Diameter NASREQ
Application.  The library implements the specification defined in
draft-ietf-aaa-diameter-nasreq-16.txt.  This document describes the
API.

\section tagBasicFeatures Basic Features

The API has the following features.

- <b>Client (NAS) and Server implementation</b> The libdiameternasreq
library provides both Diameter NASREQ client and server
implementations.

- <b>Thread safety and load balancing</b>.  The libdiametereap library
is written based on the Open Diameter Framework API, which makes the
library thread-safe and it is also possible to do load balancing among
multiple threads to achieve a maximal performance.

- <b>Open-ended API</b>.  The Diameter NASREQ API is extensible in a
way that server applications can define its own authorization
decisions for each authorization attribute carried in Diameter NASREQ
AA-Answer messages and that client applications can define its own
enforcement functions for each authorization attribute carried in
AA-Answer.  Client applications can also define "Set" functions for
each authorization attribute carried in an AA-Request to request the
server for authorization for particular attributes and "Enforce"
functions for each authorization attribute carried in an AA-Answer to
install attributes that have been authorized by the server.

- <b>OS independence</b>.  The library is developed by fully utilizing
the <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/ACE.html"> ACE
(Adaptive Communication Environment) API </A> so that it can work
major operating systems including Linux, UNIX and Windows for which
ACE is supported.
