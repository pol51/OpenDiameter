\section Introduction

The libdiametermip4 library provides a C++ API to Diameter MIP v4
(Mobile IP v4 Protocol) Application.  The library
implements the specification defined in draft-ietf-aaa-diameter-mobileip-20.txt.
This document describes the API.

\section tagBasicFeatures Basic Features

- <b>Client and Server sessions implementation</b> The libdiametermip4
library provides both Diameter MIP client and server sessions implementations 
and the related AAA Server sessions.

- <b>Thread safety and load balancing</b>.  The libdiametermip4 library
is written based on the Open Diameter Framework API, which makes the
library thread-safe and it is also possible to do load balancing among
multiple threads to achieve a maximal performance.

- <b>Open-ended API</b>.  The Diameter MIP API is an interface that allows
to provide different MIP implementation as well as the differnt implementaions
for the AAA Server functionality.


\subsection tagSubsection Client and server sessions applicable for the Diameter MIP application:

- <b>Home Agent(HA) Client Session implementation - Sends AMR</b> 

- <b>Home Agent(HA) Server Session implementation - Accepts HAR</b> 

- <b>Foreign Agent(FA) Client Session implementation - Sends AMR</b> 

- <b>AAA Server(AAAS) Server Session implementation - Accepts AMR</b> 

- <b>AAA Server(AAAS) Client Session implementation - Sends HAR</b> 


The above session classes are implemented as templates, which accepts 
as a parameter a "User Defined Class" providing the relevant MIP implementation
 or AAA Server functionality implementation.

The MIP implementation should be defined by derriving the user defined class
from the interfaces defined in the following files:

- diameter_mip4_ha_client_interface.hxx
- diameter_mip4_ha_server_interface.hxx
- diameter_mip4_fa_client_interface.hxx

The AAA Server functionality implementation should be defined by derriving 
the user defined class from the interface defined in the following file:

- diameter_mip4_aaas_server_interface.hxx

Also the FA and HA client sessions should interface with relevant Diameter-MIP 
sessions using the relevant interface in the following files (notification of 
MIP registration request arrival):

- mip4_diameter_ha_client_interface.hxx
- mip4_diameter_fa_client_interface.hxx

\section tagSample Sample Programs
Four sample programs are provided to demostrate the use of the four main 
Diameter-MIP sessions in two typical scenarions:

<b>1. Mobile Node in Co-Located Mode</b>

<b>2. Mobile Node sending AMR through a Foreign Agent</b> 


\subsection tagScenario1 Scenario 1: Mobile Node in Co-Located Mode

 This scenario includes running the HA client program and the AAA server program.

<b>Home Agent Client Session Sample Program:</b>
\include hac_test.cxx

<b>AAA Server Sample Program:</b>
\include aaas_server_test.cxx

\subsection tagScenario2 Scenario 2: Mobile Node sending AMR through a Foreign Agent
This scenario includes running the FA client program, HA server program 
and the same AAA Server program run for the first scenario.

<b>Foreign Agent Client Session Sample Program:</b>
\include fac_test.cxx

<b>Home Agent Server Session Sample Program:</b>
\include has_test.cxx
