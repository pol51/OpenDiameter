\section Introduction

The libdiametereap library provides a C++ API to Diameter EAP
(Extensible Authentication Protocol) Application.  The library
implements the specification defined in draft-ietf-aaa-eap-07.txt.
This document describes the API.

\section tagBasicFeatures Basic Features

The API has the following features.

- <b>Client (NAS) and Server implementation</b> The libdiametereap
library provides both Diameter EAP client and server implementations.

- <b>Thread safety and load balancing</b>.  The libdiametereap library
is written based on the Open Diameter Framework API, which makes the
library thread-safe and it is also possible to do load balancing among
multiple threads to achieve a maximal performance.

- <b>Open-ended API</b>.  The Diameter EAP API is extensible in a way
that server applications can define its own authorization decisions
for each authorization attribute carried in Diameter EAP Answer (DEA)
messages and that client applications can define its own enforcement
functions for each authorization attribute carried in DEA.  Client
applications can also define "Set" functions for each authorization
attribute carried in DER to request the server for authorization for
particular attributes and "Enforce" functions for each authorization
attribute carried in DEA to install attributes that have been
authorized by the server.

- <b>Support for authorization from EAP methods</b> The Diameter EAP
implementation supports the case in which either the Diameter server
or the EAP server can perform authorization procedure.

- <b>OS independence</b>.  The library is developed by fully utilizing
the <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/ACE.html"> ACE
(Adaptive Communication Environment) API </A> so that it can work
major operating systems including Linux, UNIX and Windows for which
ACE is supported.
