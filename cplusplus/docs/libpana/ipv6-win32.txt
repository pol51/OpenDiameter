Usage Notes
-----------

The descriptions in this document applies to Windows XP
running SP1 and above using Advance Networking Pack. For 
the most part, the Open Diameter PANA library uses MS IPv6 
Protocol included in this Pack in an abstracted manner via 
WinSock version 2. The only operational consideration is 
that the "Internet Connection Firewall for IPv6" does not 
automatically open any ports after installation of the Pack
(Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 817778). This means that 
PAA listen operations will be filtered. 

To view available adapters and thier filtering states:

netsh firewall show adapter

To view enabled global ports

netsh firewall show globalport

To enable PAA listen port:

netsh firewall set adapter [Adapter Firendly Name] port [PAA Listen Port]=enable protocol=udp

Implementation Notes
--------------------

There are some considerations when using Windows
Socket Ver 2 for sending multicast traffic on a
UDP socket. These considerations are based on
the difference between WinSock and linux/BSD
sockets:

a. sockaddr_in6.sin6_scope_id need not be populated
   with the proper interface index if IPV6_MULTICAST_IF
   is used.
b. bind() is required if IPV6_MULTICAST_JOIN is to
   be issued.
c. Use of GetAdapterAddresses() is prefereble in
   retrieving the actual IPv6 based interface
   index instead of GetAdaptersInfo().
