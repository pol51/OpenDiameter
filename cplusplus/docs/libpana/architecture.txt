\mainpage PANA Functional Architecture 
\author Victor I. Fajardo
\date July 21, 2004

The document is a architectural overview of the TARI 
implementation of PANA. This implementation currently 
adheres to existing PANA related drafts and will 
continue it's evolution as dictated by the drafts.

-  Configuration Files
-  Source Distribution

\section language Language 

C++ is used to allow an object oriented design approach.
This also accomodates the preferred toolset used.

\section tools Tools

The following are tools used in the implementation:

- ACE Frameworks ver 5.3 April 2003
  (http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html)
- Xerces C++ XML lib, ver 2.2.0 April 2003
  (http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html)

ACE allows implementation of complex communications
and general software patterns. This package allows 
abstractions to threading, synchronization, queueing,
logging and other generalized implementation needs that
would otherwise have to be re-invented. Although, the PANA 
does not require complex communications architecture, the 
overall coverage of ACE beyond communication needs 
significantly eases the implementation efforts. This holds 
true especially when supporting multiple platforms (windows, 
unix, etc.) since cross platform compatability has already
been addressed by this toolset. Therefore, this allows 
developers to concentrate on the init PANA functionality. 

Currently, the chosen method for static configuration
storage is an XML file. This may change in the future. The design
allows for this flexibility since the configuration formats
is dictated by the internal data structures. Hence, the 
only required change would be the internal population of these
structures which can easily be segragated via a single
object interface. As of this writing, the backend implementation
for this interface is based on Xerces C++. It is used for parsing 
and loading the XML configuration file. This package has both
SAX and DOM based API's. The PANA implementation uses DOM.

\section platform Platform Support 

PANA protocol entities will be required to exists in different
platforms. The most likely of which are UNIX and Windows.

The Pac PANA entity has a high probability of residing under
a windows environment since the predominant client devices are
running unders a windows platform (Windows CE for PDA's, XP/NT/Win9X
flavors for tablets or desktops). In the PANA draft 3 specification,
it is assumed that PANA will operate with a valid IP address. Hence,
the unspecified IP support in previous implementation has now been
deprecated. There is no longer a need for NDIS based drivers for
windows or raw socket support in UNIX systems. There are still
system calls to query configuration of network interfaces but
they will require only user level system calls.

For the PAA, a server environment with the proper scalable capabilities
are required. The PANA server entity are also required to execute in 
privileged mode specifically because of it's interaction with
the EP as well as backend AAA entities. The most probable approach is to 
implement PAA as a "server/backend" processes specific to each platform.


\section api PANA API

The PANA API model is geared towards interacting with EAP modules.
The current PANA implementation does not have dependencies to
any single EAP implementation but rather defines an API that
will interface to any EAP implementation.

The PANA API is a simple session based API model. It comprises 
generally of two (2) C++ class definitions that users can instantiate.
These are PANA_Node, PANA_PacSession. Also, required are two (2) C++ 
classes that users must derived from. These are PANA_ClientEventInterface
and PANA_PaaEventInerface. These event interfaces follow a bridge or
abstract pattern implemenation. The PANA_PaaSession can also be inherited
by users depending on what is being accomplised. The PANA_Node instance
is required for all applications. For sessions, depending on whether 
an entity will behave as a Pac or a PAA, instantiaton follows 
different patters. These are as follows:

- Pac Session Pattern

A Pac session pattern is straight forward. A PANA_Node and PANA_PacSession
instance is required. An instance of the derived class is required for
each PANA Pac session. Each instance is required to register a user class
derived from PANA_ClientEventInterface. This class overrides event
handlers invoked by the PANA library. The following is an excerpt of the sample code which better describes the Pac API:

\verbatim

class PeerApplication : public PANA_ClientEventInterface
{
 public:
  PeerApplication(PANA_Node &n) : pacSession(n, *this),
    handle(EapJobHandle(AAA_GroupedJob::Create(n.Task().Job(), this, "peer"))),
    eap(boost::shared_ptr<MyPeerSwitchStateMachine>
	(new MyPeerSwitchStateMachine(*n.Task().reactor(), handle))),
    md5Method(EapContinuedPolicyElement(EapType(4)))
  {
    eap->Policy().CurrentPolicyElement(&md5Method);
  }
  virtual ~PeerApplication()  {
    pacSession.Stop();
  }
  void Start()
  { 
    pacSession.Start();
    eap->Start(); 
  }

  MyPeerSwitchStateMachine& Eap() { return *eap; }

  // called by PANA on incomming EAP request
  void EapRequest(AAAMessageBlock *request,
                  PANA_PINFO provider,
                  const PANA_CfgProviderInfo *pInfo) {     
     eap->Receive(request);
  }
  // called by PANA on incomming BIND request
  void EapRequest(AAAMessageBlock *request,
                  ACE_UINT32 resultCode,
                  ACE_UINT32 pcap) {
     eap->Receive(request);
  }
  // called by PANA on authorization of a peer 
  void Authorize(PANA_AuthorizationArgs &args) { 
      // contents of args is as follows:
      // typedef struct {
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<PANA_DeviceId> m_Paa;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<PANA_DeviceId> m_Pac;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<diameter_octetstring_t> m_Key;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<ACE_UINT32> m_KeyId;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<ACE_UINT32> m_Lifetime;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<ACE_UINT32> m_ProtectionCapability;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<PANA_DeviceId> m_Ep;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<diameter_octetstring_t> m_DhcpKey;
      // } PANA_AuthorizationArgs;
  }
  // called by PANA on re-authentication request
  void ReAuthentication() { }
  // called by PANA on termination sequence
  void Disconnect(ACE_UINT32 cause) { }
  // called by PANA on session timeout
  void Timeout() { }
  // called by PANA on internal error or error message
  void Error(ACE_UINT32 resultCode) { }

 private:
  PANA_PacSession pacSession; // insance of PANA Pac
  EapJobHandle handle;
  boost::shared_ptr<MyPeerSwitchStateMachine> eap;
  EapContinuedPolicyElement md5Method;
};

\endverbatim

<B> Listing 1. PANA Pac API sample </B>

- PAA Session Pattern

The PAA session pattern is similar to the Pac except that the
derived auth agent objects are generated by a factory. As with the 
Pac, applications MUST derive from PANA_PaaEventInterface class and
provide application specific handlers for each session event.
The difference is in instantiation of PANA_PaaSession or classes
derived from it. PANA_PaaSession or classes derived from it MUST 
not be instantiated manually by the application but rather passed 
on as a template parameter to PANA_PacSessionFactoryAdapter<> class
or other forms of it. This class is responsible for creating instance 
of the PANA_PaaSession based object based on demand.

The following is an excerpt of the sample code which better describes
the Pac API:

\verbatim

class StandAloneAuthApplication : public PANA_PaaEventInterface
{

 public:
  StandAloneAuthApplication(PANA_Node &n) 
    : paaSession(n),
      handle(EapJobHandle(AAA_GroupedJob::Create(n.Task().Job(), this, "standalone"))),
      eap(boost::shared_ptr<MyStandAloneAuthSwitchStateMachine>
	  (new MyStandAloneAuthSwitchStateMachine(*n.Task().reactor(), handle))),
      identityMethod(EapContinuedPolicyElement(EapType(1))),
      md5Method(EapContinuedPolicyElement(EapType(4))),
      notificationMethod(EapContinuedPolicyElement(EapType(2)))
  {
    // start paa session
    paaSession.Start();
    // Policy settings for the authenticator
    identityMethod.AddContinuedPolicyElement
      (&md5Method, EapContinuedPolicyElement::PolicyOnSuccess);
    identityMethod.AddContinuedPolicyElement
      (&notificationMethod, EapContinuedPolicyElement::PolicyOnFailure);
    eap->Policy().CurrentPolicyElement(&identityMethod);
  }
  virtual ~StandAloneAuthApplication() {
    paaSession.Stop();
  }

  // called by PANA on accepting initial PANA start answer from peer
  void EapStart() {
     eap->Start();
  }
  // called by PANA on incomming EAP response
  void EapResponse(AAAMessageBlock *response, bool separate) { 
     eap->Receive(response);
  }
  // called by PANA on authorization of a peer 
  void Authorize(PANA_AuthorizationArgs &args) { 
      // contents of args is as follows:
      // typedef struct {
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<PANA_DeviceId> m_Paa;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<PANA_DeviceId> m_Pac;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<diameter_octetstring_t> m_Key;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<ACE_UINT32> m_KeyId;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<ACE_UINT32> m_Lifetime;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<ACE_UINT32> m_ProtectionCapability;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<PANA_DeviceId> m_Ep;
      //   AAA_ScholarAttribute<diameter_octetstring_t> m_DhcpKey;
      // } PANA_AuthorizationArgs;
  }
  // called by PANA on re-authentication request
  void ReAuthentication() { }
  // called by PANA on termination sequence
  void Disconnect(ACE_UINT32 cause) { }
  // called by PANA on session timeout
  void Timeout() { }
  // called by PANA on internal error or error message
  void Error(ACE_UINT32 resultCode) { }

  //  MyEapStandAloneAuthSession& Eap() { return eap; }
  MyStandAloneAuthSwitchStateMachine& Eap() { return *eap; }

  PANA_PaaSession &paa() { return paaSession; }

 private:
  PANA_PaaSession paaSession; // PAA session
  EapJobHandle handle;
  boost::shared_ptr<MyStandAloneAuthSwitchStateMachine> eap;
  EapContinuedPolicyElement identityMethod;
  EapContinuedPolicyElement md5Method;
  EapContinuedPolicyElement notificationMethod;
};

class StandAloneSessionFactoryAdapter : public PANA_PaaSessionFactory
{
   public:
      StandAloneSessionFactoryAdapter(PANA_Node &n) :
	PANA_PaaSessionFactory(n), node(n) { }
      // virtual abstract method that needs to be implemented by the user
      PANA_PaaSession *Create() {
         StandAloneAuthApplication *app = new StandAloneAuthApplication(node, sem);
         if (app) {
	    return &(app->paa());
	 }
         return (0);
      }
   protected:
      PANA_Node &node;
};

\section server Server Architecture

The server architecture as shown in Fig. 1 is subdivided into the 
following functional modules. Note that this current descriptions
are depiction of the initial design elements and are subject to
change.

- Core Module
This contains general process specific objects not necessarily
related to protocol features. It is responsible for loading
and maintaining configuration data extracted from an XML 
configuration file. It also contains general system facilities required
by the implementation such as logging and timer services. There
are two (2) key facilities provided by the init module that pertains
directly to a scalable and optimized performace of PANA entity. The 
first is a task object. The server design relies heavily
on parallelized execution of all internal functions. This means
that all logical functionality within the server is granulated
into jobs and distributed among threads in the pool for execution. 
Note also that the task object's job queue is a priority queue
and job entries can contain weights. This introduces a primitive
scheduler to the task objects job queue. Care MUST be taken in 
ensuring that no low priority jobs are starved (left in the queue) 
because of to many high priority jobs being enqueued. The number of threads 
within the task object can be controlled via configuration files. 
The second facility is the use of a memory pool. This has the 
effect of minimizing context switching due to system call when 
the PAA request for memory from the system. In addition, it 
provides a more optimal use of memory since it is a re-use algorithm. 

In addition to these generalized services, the init module
also manages interfaces (API's) to entities outside of the PAA. These 
interfaces are required by PANA to operate properly. The 
first of which is the EP interface. Based on the PANA draft,
communication with the PAA and the EP may be based on a
separate protocol (if EP is remote) or an API call (if EP
is co-located). In either case, a generic EP interface MUST
be implemented to shield the init PANA modules from this
diverse linkage. The next interface is the AAA interface which would
allow the PAA to pass EAP traffic to any type of backend
AAA entity. As with the EP interface, a generic AAA interface
MUST be implemented to shield the init PANA modules. In addition,
this interface must allow for the flexibility of one or more
backend AAA entities to exists. Both these interfaces must be
configurable via the configuration file.

A timer queue is also present in the init module. It has it's
own thread that efficiently triggers on the next calculated
timing request for the PANA entity. An independent timer thread
was chosen so as not to produce latency in any timing request.
The handler for an expired timer, however, is still executed 
within the task object thread context.

- Transport Module

The transport module consist of an egress scheduler
(message transmission), and ingress scheduler. The functions 
of each can be described using ingress and egress traffic. 

There exists a listener job to service incomming PANA traffic.
This job performs a blocking read on the libraries UDP socket.
PANA traffic can come either in UDP or multicast forms. In both
cases, once a complete message is received by packet filter, the
message is immediately queued for ingress scheduling. Queueing
is done by passing raw buffered data into the task's job
queue to be picked up by the next available thread. Once it's
processed, the message is parsed into an internal message data
structure. A partial check for validity (See 4.1.6 of the PANA
draft) is made before being queued for processing by the ingress
scheduler. The logical boundary of the transport module is the
ingress scheduler. 

For the egress traffic, all entities within the PAA queues thier
outgoing pre-composed message into the egress scheduler. As with any
other jobs in the software, queueing is done by passing the message
along with the job to the thread pool. The first available thread
would then provide an execution context for the transmission of the
message.

- Session Module

The session module consist of the session resolution, message validation
and state machine hanlders (discovery, authorization and termination handler).
As with the other modules, execution context is provided by the thread pool. 

The session resolution is the boundary of the session module
as seen from the transport module. All PANA traffic is received by 
the session resolution. Messages are parsed messages (from raw buffers) 
passed in by the transport module. The session resolutin makes queries 
to the session database to determine the session object the message 
belongs to. If found, full validation of the message is then made 
(See 4.1.6 of PANA draft). If it passes validation, the messages 
will then be queued to the proper state machine handlers (discover, 
authoriation and termination).

A special case is made for PANA start answer message since a new session 
has to be created for this newly verified client. PANA discover 
messages are passed on to the discovery handler in a stateless manner.
The server does not store state information but merely generates a
cookie based on the Pac device id. On a successful discovery phase,
an attempt is made to add a new session to the session databas 
upon receipt of a valid start answer message.
(See Fig 2. and Fig 3. of Sec. 4.2 of the PANA Draft).

The state machine handlers, implements Sec. 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 
of the PANA Draft.  Details of it's functioning is best describe 
in the draft itself. Note that internal auxiallry functions exists 
in composing egress messages generated by these handlers.  

\image html server_architecture.jpeg
\image latex server_architecture.eps
<B> Figure 1. PANA Server Functional Architecture </B>

Note that the session database is necessary to manage simultaneous 
ongoing peer sessions. It is recommended that a fast access database
structure be used in implementing the session database. Current
implementation uses an Red-Black tree for storing session entries.
The current state plus all other functional data required to maintain
a PANA session will be stored in these session entries. In addtion,
SA (security association) data will also be stored in these entries.

\section client Client Architecture

The client architecture as shown in Fig. 2 is subdivided into the 
following functional modules. Note that this current descriptions
are depiction of the initial design elements and maybe subject to
change in future revisions.

- Core Module

The init module for the Pac is exactly the same as for the PAA. 
All auxillary features such as thread and memory pooling present.
As describe in the server architecture, the excution context for
all logical functions of the Pac will also be provided by the
thread pool. The major differences in the Pac init module is 
that the management of EP and AAA interface is not present. What is
present is an API that exposes the PANA client entity to the system.
(which is also present in the PAA). 

- Transport Module

The transport module of Pac is similar to that of the PAA. The only 
difference is the validation of PANA messages which may have Pac
specific checks. The egress scheduler as well as the ingress scheduler
remains the same. The egress scheduler still functions as a broker for 
transmitting composed PANA messages. It also uses the low level packet 
filters exclusively for sending and receiving PANA traffic. For the 
incomming message processing, the functions are similar to the PAA
except that the received message is passed on immediately to the 
state machine handlers instead of having an additional session resolution
entity. 

- Session Module

The session module is composed simply of the state machine handlers. 
As with the PAA, the state machine handlers is responsible for implementing 
the init PANA functionality as it relates to a Pac. Sec. 4 or the PANA draft 
describes this in detail. However, unlike the PAA session module which has 
a session resolution entity  responsible for matching ingress messages to existing 
sessions, a PANA client entity has at most one active session at any given 
moment (this may change in the future). Message validity checking is done 
by auxillary objects within the state machine handler.  A session database 
does not exist in the PANA client entity. It does not have significant use at 
this time.

\section build Building, Installing and Running

As noted above, PANA can be built in both windows and linux. Instructions
for both are as follows:

1. Linux/UNIX: There is an autconf script at the root the PANA library
   directory. To build, simply run the configure script, <b>./configure</b>.
   This will check for all necessary third-party libraries and environment
   settings. If configuration is successful, simply run <b>make</b> to build
   the library. Installation can be done by running <b>make install</b> although
   this can be done manually to suit the users environment (i.e. copying
   the source and headers to a directory appropriate for the user).
   You can also run the sample code pana_test1 from a user command line.

2. Win32: Installation under windows consist of a <b>Windows Installer</b>
   program that is downloaded from the distribution site. The windows
   installer currently install only source and header files for PANA 
   plus pre-built binaries (DLL's and sample code only). The installer
   is a standard windows installer that allows you flexibility on the
   target directory where the PANA files will be installed. The installer
   also registers with the <b>Add/Remove Programs</b> list in the windows
   <b>Control Panel</b> for easy removal/re-installation. If you wish to
   rebuild the DLL's and sample code, the use of VC++ 7.1 (.NET 2003) is 
   required. There is a Solutions directory directly under the PANA
   library root. Under this directory, there is a solutions file PANA.sln
   that contains references to all the project files that PANA requires. 
   It also includes the project file for the "Windows Installer" itself. 
   When running VC++ 7.1, you can selectively build whichever target 
   you wish but the base dependencies is the PANA DLL.

\section config Configuration Files

The configuation files for both Pac and PAA are XML based. Most entries
in the configuration file are self explanatory and hence an excerpt of
a sample configuration file are shown here. Note that the difference
between the Pac and PAA configuration is that the Pac has an extra
configuration section. Differences are noted below:

\section source Source Distribution
 
The current implementation of PANA entities (client and server) involves
support for multiple platforms as stated in Sec. 3 of this document. The
directory structure below shows the outline of the source tree.

\verbatim

PANA_ROOT
    |
   \docs                 # documentation
      \win32             # object files and executables
      \linux             # object files and binaries 
       ...
   \include              # API's for accessing PANA entity from the device 
   \src                  # PANA init source code
      \linux             # Linux specific transport source code
      \win32             # Windows specific transport source code
   \config               # Configuration files
   \drivers              # Packet filtering drivers
   \Solutions            # Solutions directory for VC++ .NET files
       ...

Notes: UNIX autoconf files exist in the PANA_ROOT directory.
       All source code that implements the init PANA functionality resides
       in PANA_ROOT\src. All header files exposed to the system (via DLL
       in windows) are in PANA_ROOT\include. PANA_ROOT\config
       will contain XML configuration files for linux based systems.
       
       For unix systems, autoconf was used to generate makefiles. Therefore,
       you need to run the 'configure' script from builds/$OS directory to
       allow a clean cross compile environment. You may run configure from
       the PANA_ROOT directory but it will distribute the build the binaries
       inside the source directories.

\endverbatim

Note that the include directories exposes the EP interface and the 
AAA interface for PAA and the PANA API for the Pac. RADIUS and
DIAMETER modules (and others) are backend hooks to for the AAA 
interface and allows the PAA to interact with various AAA entities.
These modules are also configurable via entries in the XML configuration
files.
