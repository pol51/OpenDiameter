Open Diameter: Binary Applications

Copyright (C) 2002-2005 Open Diameter Project

INSTALLATION
------------

NASD and AAAD can be built and installed using the exsting
root configure script. Building and installing can be done
using the steps:

$ configure --prefix=[prefered directory]
$ make
$ make install

Note that the default prefix directory is /usr/local. The
configuration files for NASD and AAAD will then be installed
in $(prefix)/opendiameter/aaa and $(prefix)/opendiameter/nas.


USING
-----

At the moment there is not init.d/rc.d scripts that comes
with the deamon applications. So executing the binaries
are done manually. Note that both binaries required the
master configuration files be passed in as a parameter. If
the configuration files is not passed in, it will assume
that the files are located in /etc/opendiameter/[nas|aaa]/config.

So, as an example, NASD can be executed:

./nasd -f $(prefix)/opendiameter/nas/config/nasd.xml

NASD Overview
-------------

The NASD (Network access server deamon) application is designed
to be installed at the edge of the network to provide access
protocol functionality on the user edge and AAA protocol on the
inner edge. The anchor protocol for both access and AAA is EAP.
So in general, NASD acts as an EAP passthrough for authenticating
users. In addition, for each user or group of users that attempts 
to auth, NASD is capable of performing "policy" enforcement. At 
the moment it is also capable of local authentication. Further
details can be found in http://www.opendiameter.org. As of 1.0.7-f, 
the application is an ALPHA version and futher mutations of this 
application is very likely. The currently supported protocols are 
as follows:

Access protocols:

  a. PANA

AAA protocols

  a. Diameter EAP
  b. Local EAP auth (not really an AAA but NASD 
     treats it that way)
     

Since NASD uses many different protocols, each protocl can have
it's own specific configuration file. A master configuration file
is used to consolidate them (config/nasd.xml). The master config
file maintains four(4) lists:

a. <access_protocols> This list the available access protocols
   that is supported by NASD. Each protocol is defined in an
   <access_entry> where protocol specific configuration is 
   defined. One can also enable or disable support for a specific
   protocol within this configuration entry. See config/nasd.xml.

b. <aaa_protocols> Same as above. This list all the supported AAA
   protocols by NASD. Each protocol is defined in an <aaa_entry>
   where protocol specific configuration is defined. This may 
   include entries for configuration files etc. See config/nasd.xml.

c. <access_policy> Access polices are enforcement policies that
   that the NASD executes for each user or group of users that
   attempts authentication/authorization. a <policy_entry> defines
   a type of policy that can be done. This is dependent on the EP
   (enforcement point) capabilities and features. See config/nasd.xml.

d. <call_routing> Defines how a incomming user auth is handled.
   Each call (user auth attempt) that arrives and the NASD is 
   identified by it's NAI. NASD has a call router that attempts 
   to do best match on the users NAI with the <route_entry>'s 
   defined in this list. The matching algorithim is defined in 
   config/nasd.xml. A <route_entry> defines the access policy 
   that is to be applied to this call and which AAA protocol to
   use to route the call to the proper authenticator. A <route_entry>
   can have multiple policies that is executed for each call. If 
   no match is found, a <default_route_entry> is used to handle
   the call. See http://www.opendiameter.org for details of the
   call architecture.
   
Root directory for NASD is $(OPENDIAMETER)/applications/nas

AAAD Overview
-------------

The AAAD (AAA deamon) is designed to provide a framework for
implementing different diameter applications within a single
deamon. It is based solely on the use of libdiameter and simply
provides a shell for additional diameter application implementation.
As of 1.0.7-f, only diameter EAP is available. This supplements
the testing of NASD.

As with NASD, the master configuration file is located in 
config/aaad.xml. This file has <diameter_cfg_file> that points
to the location of the libdiameter configuration file. It also
defines a list of supported diameter application (<applications>).
Each entry in the list <application_entry>, defines specific
configuration requirements for the supported application.

Root directory for NASD is $(OPENDIAMETER)/applications/aaa

AAAD - Diameter EAP application
-------------------------------

For Diameter EAP application, the <application_entry> in
config/aaad.xml has <user_db> which refers to the user database 
which is used to determine how a user or group of users is 
to be authenticated. The user database provides a list of 
<user_entry> that is matched with a users NAI. Matching 
algorithim is defined in config/aaad_user_db.xml. If a match
is found, <user_entry> defines the EAP method to be used in
authentication the user. As of 1.0.7-f, only MD5 and archie EAP 
methods are supported. Each method has it's specific configuration
for each <user_entry>. For MD5, the user database may also contain
the shared secret string to be used for generating the challenge.
This is NOT RECOMMENDED since this configuration maybe insecure.
For archie, a <user_entry> may point to different shared secret
file. If no <user_entry> match is found for a user's NAI, a 
<default_entry> is used for the user. Further details can be
found in http://www.opendiameter.org.
